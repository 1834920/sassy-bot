## Who Is Sassy-Bot?

- Sassy-Bot will randomly select and construct a message to return to whoever called it.
- The responses are designed to be kind of snobby but still funny and should always be vague.
- I would like to note I did not make this design responsive yet as the image is just one layer.  I will separate everything into individual image assets so that placement can be done more easily for all viewport sizes.

### Language

We will code this bot with JavaScript to begin with and will use HTML and CSS as needed to style a user interface.

*Please keep checking back for progress!*
